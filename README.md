Muddle Interactive Graphics Graphics System
 is a vector drawing graphics system originaly inplimented in the mid 1970s
 in the MUDDLE (MDL) programming environment at MIT-DMS. It supports many of the
 graphics avaiable at that timed over the ARPANET. Below is the introducxtion
 from the MIGS Manual, "MIGS ORDER". "MIGS RECECNT" documents new add features.

IDENTIFICATION
     M.I.G.S. - MUDDLE INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS SYSTEM
     RICHARD R. SHIFFMAN
     OCTOBER 30, 1973

MOTIVATION
     I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS A GENERAL NEED FOR AN
   INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS SYSTEM THAT RUNS IN A TIMESHARING
   ENVIRONMENT. THE GREATEST USE FOR SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE
   IN ENGINEERING, MATH, AND PHYSICS. THE ADVANTAGES OF 
   INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS OVER
   NORMAL COMPUTER AIDED INSTRUCTION ARE OBVIOUS. A
   STUDENT OR RESEARCHER CAN SIT DOWN AT A LOW COST GRAPHICS
   TERMINAL AND SEE A PICTURE OF THE FUNCTION HE IS
   INTERESTED IN. THIS LEADS TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF
   THE PROBLEM, AND ALSO ALLOWS EXPERIMENTATION THAT WOULD
   BE TOO DIFFICULT TO DO BY HAND. FOR A STUDENT THIS WOULD
   MEAN GREATER INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT AND HOPEFULLY
   BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT.
     I BELIEVE THAT THE ARPA NETWORK IS IDEAL FOR THE
   DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM, SINCE IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE
   FROM MANY COLLEGES AND RESEARCH CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY.
   MY ORIGINAL CHOICE OF M.I.T.-D.M.C.G. AND MUDDLE TO
   DEVELOP THIS PACKAGE WAS TAKEN AT RANDOM, BUT THE RESEARCH
   ORIENTED ATMOSPHERE OF DMCG AND THE POWERFUL INTERACTIVE
   ENVIRONMENT OF MUDDLE (A RECURSIVE LIST PROCESSING
   LANGUAGE) PROVED IDEAL FOR THIS PROJECT

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
     NOT BEING A MEMBER OF PROJECT MAC, BUT JUST A PERSON WHO
   APPEARED ON THE SYSTEM, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO
   THANK EVERYBODY AT DMCG FOR TOLERATING ME ON THE SYSTEM.
   IN THIS RESPECT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AL VEZZA FOR THE
   DIRECTORY AND THE CPU TIME. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK
   GREG PFISTER, BRUCE DANIELS, AND CHRIS REEVE, WHO
   REMAINED CIVIL, EVEN THOUGH I ALWAYS SEEMED TO LINK TO
   THEM AT INOPPORTUNE TIMES AND ASKED MANY QUESTIONS.
